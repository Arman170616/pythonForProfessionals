print(messages[random.randint(0, len(messages) -1)])

#random.randint(0, len(messages) - 1)  This produces a random number to use
# for the index, regardless of the size of messages . That is, youâ€™ll get a ran-
# dom number between 0 and the value of len(messages) - 1 . The benefit of
# this approach is that you can easily add and remove strings to the messages
# list without changing other lines of code. If you later update your code,
# there will be fewer lines you have to change and fewer chances for you to
# introduce bugs
